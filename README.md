# RS School REST service

![PostgreSQL, nodejs, Docker](./assets/techs.png)

This application is a [Trello](https://trello.com/) competitor. It can be used for managing tasks and boards. Backend is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework to handle requests in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) server. It may be used on every type of OS because it works inside isolated [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. Data is stored inside [PostgreSQL](postgresql.org) database.

## Docker üê≥

This application is using docker compose file to declare and build images. Also it creates user defined network between containers.
To run the entire app use the next command in your terminal in the project root directory

```sh
docker compose up
```

This command will build containers with app and postgreSQL database. The size of app container is 270 MB.

When containers start, the application waits for the Postgres container to start first.

If you want to keep your terminal free of logs you may use the next command

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

To see logs from the container in the detached mode use

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

If any error occurs container will be automatically restarted.

Logs and data are stored outside containers (in volumes), that is why they will be saved even if you delete images from your PC and then rebuild it again.

Nodemon watches after changes inside _src_ directory and will rebuild containers.

There is no need to rebuild images after changes inside .env file.

To stop containers use

```sh
docker compose stop
```

To stop and delete containers use

```sh
docker compose down
```

To delete images from your PC use

```sh
docker image rm <image ID>
```

The image of this app is in private Docker Hub repository [okitel/rsschool-nodejs-service](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/okitel/rsschool-nodejs-service).

To launch tests you need to install all dependencies into the root directory. There are no tests inside docker containers.

### Documentation

Typedoc is installed so you can generate documentation based on tsdoc. To do this, use the following script:

```sh
npm run docs
```
